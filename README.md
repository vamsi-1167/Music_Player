# Music_Player
I created a frontend music player application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player supports essential music controls like play, pause, next, previous, progress tracking, and volume adjustment. JavaScript is used to handle audio playback, update the UI dynamically, and manage user interactions.
